# HandgunHoedown

_**Handgun Hoedown**_ is a local multiplayer western action game about having a hoedown with handguns! Get to a gun as quickly as possible and shoot your nemesis right between the eyes - if you haven't got a trusty revolver, run for your life until you can get one or punch the gun right out of their hands! First cowboy to three kills wins.

**THIS GAME IS BEST PLAYED WITH 2 XBOX 360 CONTROLLERS. You can play with split keyboard or a combinaton of keyboard/controller, but we really recommend using controllers for the best experience!**

## Known Bugs

- Using keyboard, some animations don't trigger
- On Mac, when going through level select the game will hang for a moment, but will function regularly after that
- The game is tested with Xbox 360 Controllers, but the game can be played with a Logitech F310, though turning doesn't work properly
